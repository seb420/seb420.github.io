            <p><mark>
                This is the third year for this popular event, which
                happens early in Term 2. We aim to give people a great time
                enjoying fantastic vegetarian & vegan food together and raise
                money for environmental projects here at Onslow and further
                afield. Students are needed to advertise the event, make great
                food, set up the hall, lay tables, serve food, provide cool
                music, collect money and tidy up afterwards. This event is
                buzzing. We also need a couple of co-leaders to manage the
                event, talk to media and work with teachers to make it great.

            <p><mark>
                We have built garden beds and grow great food in a Community
                Garden on Table Mountain and in the enclosed Education Garden.
                Onslow’s forest restoration areas next to the Waipahihi Stream
                and on Table Mountain aims to make our school rich in native
                animals and plants. For this project we need a gardening team
                to build garden beds, run a composting program, plant, weed
                and harvest our own good food. We also need a forest restoration
                team to plant native trees in cleared areas and weed and care
                for the establishing plants as well as co-leaders who can work
                with teachers to plan and run gardening and restoration events.

                We work with Papa Taiao Earthcare to monitor native and invasive
                species and control predators. NCEA credits are available
                through this program. Teams of at least five students to work
                on this project with wildlife in our restoration areas, while
                co-leaders co-ordinate the group and work with the great people

            <p><mark>
                The group promotes and co-ordinates recycling at Onslow. We
                advocate for waste minimisation at the school, including
                reduction in plastics. See this video about plastics in the
                ocean: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7er8z58"
                          target="_blank">here</a>. We also
                organise school
                cleanups, show films and promote Onslow’s reusable cups.
                We have a team who work to reduce waste, promote recycling
                and experiment with innovative ways to make Onslow very good at
                these things. There are also a couple of co-leaders who work
                with teachers and co-ordinate the team.
